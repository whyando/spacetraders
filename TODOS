GATE SPEEDUPS:
- maybe rush at end
- maybe 2nd hauler purely for rush
- ore haulers unload iron ore + copper ore together

- accounting (net worth etc)
- api stats
- segment market db tables by reset_date

- charting
- multi system pathfinding
- make the task manager distances more accurate


how to handle when approaching rate limit?
can I better centralise the app state?
