GATE SPEEDUPS:
- prio fabmats when credits low
- don't overevolve iron import
- maybe rush at end
- maybe 2nd hauler purely for rush
- implement credit threshold to wait after initial ships bought
- ore haulers unload iron ore + copper ore together



- accounting (net worth etc)
- api stats
- segment market db tables by reset_date


- charting
- multi system pathfinding
- make the task manager distances more accurate


how to handle when approaching rate limit?
can I better centralise the app state?
