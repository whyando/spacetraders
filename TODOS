CURRENT FEATURE STATUS:

right now we're mostly functional as a effective single ship trader, augmented by a few probes.

feature - ship buying (50%)
- ship buying occurs at startup
- ships have a task that allows them to buy + launch new ships: currently untested since we aren't scheduling the task

feature - multiple logistic ships (50%)
- ships can run in parallel, and share the task manager, and can execute in parallel,
- just needs some state in task manager so it can be smart enough not to schedule overlapping tasks
- need to actually add some cargo ships to the ship_config

feature - probing markets/shipyards (90%)
- probes are bought as described in ship buying feature
- polling their target seems to works well
- to finish this we need to stop scheduling refresh logistic tasks, when a probe has arrived at its destination

feature - intra system analysis

feature - inter system analysis

feature - contracts

feature - construction

feature - mineral extraction

feature - gas extraction



future todos rough ideas:

hardening
- task with buy good conditionally (price, supply, don't go below a specific level of agent credits)
- (cancel the sell task if the buy task was not taken)
- buy + sell tasks can handle changing trade volumes
- api rate limiting (2 /sec)
- mostly fault torerant due to the schedule progress saving, but it is possible to break in a place where goods have been bought but the step is not saved
  this needs fixing
- currently ship travel duration calc used in planning is an (under)estimate, so may get behind on schedule

eras
- progress to different eras based on conditions like credits
   different eras see different amounts of ships
- enabling construction tasks
- enabling contract tasks
- maybe command ship switches to mining
- autobuying ships
- autobuying probes for market prices (+ running probe logic)
- planning window might need to be longer or overlapping with the slower ships

eras+
- when we constructed the jump gate
- explorer ships
- trading within other systems (capital)
- multi-system trading
- more ships available
- api rate limit becomes the main bottleneck for credits/hour

analysis
- postgres+timescaledb+grafana graphs
- market prices/supply/activity over time
- market transactions over time
- agent credits over time
- agent worth over time (counting ships + goods at book cost)
- rate limit usage
- ship 'lateness' compared to schedule

super analysis
- mapping market prices to a more accurate supply
- nailing down market formulas for production/consumption per hour
- nailing down conditions for activity changes, and evolutions
- estimated credits per hour cap for a full system
